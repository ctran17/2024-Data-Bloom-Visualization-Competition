# 2024 Data Bloom Visualization Competition
This project showcases my data modeling using Microsoft Excel and visualization using Microsoft Power BI to demonstrate the impact of different service scopes on revenue growth of fictional consulting company Qdata. 
1. Data modeling using Microsoft Excel:
   - Contain data provided by Professor Dan Keating's CIS211: Business Modeling with Excel's Fall 2023 semester.
   - I calculated Total Revenue of the company's Consulting Projects using SUMIFS.
3. Data visualization using Microsoft Power BI:
   - I connected the Excel file above to Microsoft Power BI for visualization.
   - I used a combination of slicer, pie chart, stacked column chart combined with line chart, and funnel chart to showcase different aspects of Qdata's consulting services
   - I added Revenue Variance in my stacked column chart as a line chart to showcase the difference between the company's Scheduled and Delivered Revenue.
